<h3>About Me âœ¨</h3> <br/>
  
  :computer: I have always cultivated a **passion** for scientific subjects and computer science. Starting with an engineering background, I attended a Professional Master's Programme in Data Science and, over time, I have gained a deep understanding of the **Machine Learning** and **NLP** fields. 

ðŸ”­ Currently, I deal with the design, development and deployment of systems based on machine learning models and other information retrieval tools for [01S](https://www.01s.it/).

:hearts: I love ML because it lies at the crossroads between programming craftsmanship and scientific research. I am fascinated by open problems. I am able to read and understand papers and combine ideas to create new solutions. I also enjoy turning prototypes into production-ready software so my work can have a **real impact** on people.

I have successfully participated in some machine learning competitions and I like to contribute to open sourceâ€¦  
  
In my spare time:
* I often take meditative walks :walking:
* I dedicate myself to social volunteering :star:
* I am part of a theatre group, I read, I watch films... :art:
