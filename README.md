<details><summary><strong>About Me ✨</strong></summary>
  
💫 Structural Engineer turned Software Engineer with a **passion** for exploring the realms of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing.

🔍 Formerly at 01S for 5 years, I specialized in information extraction and retrieval from unstructured documents, making valuable information accessible to Italian citizens.

💙 Currently, I am proud to be part of deepset, contributing to [Haystack](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack), the open-source LLM Framework 🏗️. I enjoy engaging with a vibrant community of users and contributors.
  
In my spare time:
* I often take meditative walks :walking:
* I dedicate myself to social volunteering :star:
* I am part of a theatre group, I read, I watch films... :art:
