<details><summary><strong>About Me ✨</strong></summary>
  
💫 Software Engineer with a passion for Language Models, open source and knowledge sharing.

🔍 Previously at 01S, I specialized in information extraction and retrieval from unstructured documents, making valuable information accessible to Italian citizens.

👨‍💻 Now at deepset, I contribute to [Haystack](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack), an open-source LLM framework and its ecosystem. I enjoy engaging with the community and sharing what I learn and spend time working on.
  
In my spare time:
* I often take meditative walks :walking:
* I dedicate myself to social volunteering :star:
* I listen to music, read, watch movies... :art:
